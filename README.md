# SETI Projects
My work at the Berkeley SETI Research Center

Currently I'm exploring the possibility of incorporating a Breakthrough Listen reciever into 
the NenuFAR instrument in Nan√ßay, France.
Related work is recorded in my repo [NenuFAR](https://github.com/FX196/nenufar).

I'm also working on enhancements of [Blimpy](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/blimpy). 
Which is a Python module used by SETI researchers for processing and analyzing data from our observations.
